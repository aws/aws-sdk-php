This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes.</p> <p>You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls for Amazon Chime. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
