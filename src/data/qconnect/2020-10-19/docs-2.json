Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon Bedrock, users can take full advantage of the controls implemented in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety, security, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p> </note> <p>Amazon Q in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is an LLM-enhanced evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time recommendations to help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately.</p> <p>Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during calls and chats using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU). It then provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents can also query Amazon Q in Connect directly using natural language or keywords to answer customer requests.</p> <p>Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base, for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-q-connect.html\">Use Amazon Q in Connect for generative AI powered agent assistance in real-time</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>.</p>",

This type of language is also labeled as bullying.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Sexual</b>: Describes input prompts and model responses that indicates sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indirect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Violence</b>: Describes input prompts and model responses that includes glorification of, or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt, or injury toward a person, group, or thing.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Content filtering depends on the confidence classification of user inputs and FM responses across each of the four harmful categories. All input and output statements are classified into one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) for each harmful category. For example, if a statement is classified as <i>Hate</i> with HIGH confidence, the likelihood of the statement representing hateful content is high. A single statement can be classified across multiple categories with varying confidence levels. For example, a single statement can be classified as <i>Hate</i> with HIGH confidence, <i> Insults</i> with LOW confidence, <i>Sexual</i> with NONE confidence, and <i>Violence</i> with MEDIUM confidence.</p>",
