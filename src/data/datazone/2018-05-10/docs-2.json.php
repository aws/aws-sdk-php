It provides both basic and advanced search functionality, allowing users to find resources based on names, descriptions, metadata, and other attributes. SearchListings also supports filtering using various criteria such as creation date, owner, or status. This API is essential for making the wealth of data resources in an organization discoverable and usable, helping users find the right data for their needs quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>SearchListings returns results in a paginated format. When the result set is large, the response will include a nextToken, which can be used to retrieve the next page of results.</p> <p>The SearchListings API gives users flexibility in specifying what kind of search is run.</p> <p>To run a free-text search, the <code>searchText</code> parameter must be supplied. By default, all searchable fields are indexed for semantic search and will return semantic matches for SearchListings queries. To prevent semantic search indexing for a custom form attribute, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datazone/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFormType.html">CreateFormType API documentation</a>. To run a lexical search query, enclose the query with double quotes (""). This will disable semantic search even for fields that have semantic search enabled and will only return results that contain the keywords wrapped by double quotes (order of tokens in the query is not enforced). Free-text search is supported for all attributes annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable.</p> <p>To run a filtered search, provide filter clause using the filters parameter. To filter on glossary terms, use the special attribute <code>__DataZoneGlossaryTerms</code>.</p> <p> To find out whether an attribute has been annotated and indexed for a given search type, use the GetFormType API to retrieve the form containing the attribute.</p>', 'SearchTypes' => '<p>Searches for types in Amazon DataZone.</p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The --domain-identifier must refer to an existing Amazon DataZone domain. </p> </li> <li> <p>--search-scope must be one of the valid values including: ASSET_TYPE, GLOSSARY_TERM_TYPE, DATA_PRODUCT_TYPE.</p> </li> <li> <p>The --managed flag must be present without a value.</p> </li> <li> <p>The user must have permissions for form or asset types in the domain.</p> </li> <li> <p>If using --filters, ensure that the JSON is valid.</p> </li> <li> <p>Filters contain correct structure (attribute, value, operator).</p> </li> </ul>', 'SearchUserProfiles' => '<p>Searches user profiles in Amazon DataZone.</p>', 'StartDataSourceRun' => '<p>Start the run of the specified data source in Amazon DataZone.</p>', 'StartMetadataGenerationRun' => '<p>Starts the metadata generation run.</p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Asset must be created and belong to the specified domain and project. </p> </li> <li> <p>Asset type must be supported for metadata generation (e.g., Amazon Web Services Glue table).</p> </li> <li> <p>Asset must have a structured schema with valid rows and columns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Valid values for --type: BUSINESS_DESCRIPTIONS, BUSINESS_NAMES.</p> </li> <li> <p>The user must have permission to run metadata generation in the domain/project.</p> </li> </ul>', 'TagResource' => '<p>Tags a resource in Amazon DataZone.</p>', 'UntagResource' => '<p>Untags a resource in Amazon DataZone.</p>', 'UpdateAccountPool' => '<p>Updates the account pool.</p>', 'UpdateAssetFilter' => '<p>Updates an asset filter.</p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The domain, asset, and asset filter identifier must all exist. </p> </li> <li> <p>The asset must contain the columns being referenced in the update.</p> </li> <li> <p>If applying a row filter, ensure the column referenced in the expression exists in the asset schema.</p> </li> </ul>', 'UpdateConnection' => '<p>Updates a connection.
