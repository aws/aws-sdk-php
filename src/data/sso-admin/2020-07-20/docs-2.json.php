For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p> </note> <p>This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which could be used for access management of AWS accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals.
