Tags are metadata that you assign to your managed instances. Tags enable you to categorize your managed instances in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account\'s managed instances that helps you track each instance\'s owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 10 tags. </p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don\'t have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. </p> <p>For more information about tags, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources</a> in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. </p>', 'CancelCommand' => '<p>Attempts to cancel the command specified by the Command ID.
