For recovery points of Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Aurora resources, this status occurs when the retention period of a continuous backup rule is changed.</p> <p>To resolve <code>STOPPED</code> status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.</p> <p>For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 <code>STOPPED</code> status occurs due to user action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure.
