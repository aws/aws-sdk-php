Using the Cedar policy language, you can define fine-grained policies that specify which interactions with Gateway tools are permitted based on input parameters and OAuth claims, ensuring agents operate within defined boundaries and business rules. The policy is validated during creation against the Cedar schema generated from the Gateway's tools' input schemas, which defines the available tools, their parameters, and expected data types.

Generated policy assets are automatically deleted after 7 days, so you should review and create policies from the generated assets within this timeframe. Once created, policies are permanent and not subject to this expiration. Generated policies should be reviewed and tested in log-only mode before deploying to production.
