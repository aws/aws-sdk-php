With this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html">What is shared id="EMR-EKS"/&gt;</a>.</p> <p> <i>Amazon EMR containers</i> is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The <code>emr-containers</code> prefix is used in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, <code>aws emr-containers start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, <code>"Action": [ "emr-containers:StartJobRun"]</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions">Policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR on EKS service endpoints. For example, <code>emr-containers.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>.
