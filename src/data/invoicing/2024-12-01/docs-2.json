As you create new accounts within your Organizations using Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration APIs, you can automate the creation of new invoice units and subsequently automate the addition of new accounts to your invoice units.</p> <p>Service endpoint</p> <p>You can use the following endpoints for Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>https://invoicing.us-east-1.api.aws</code> </p> </li> </ul>",
