By using Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration, you can configure invoice units that are groups of Amazon Web Services accounts that represent your business entities, and receive separate invoices for each business entity. You can also assign a unique member or payer account as the invoice receiver for each invoice unit. As you create new accounts within your Organizations using Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration APIs, you can automate the creation of new invoice units and subsequently automate the addition of new accounts to your invoice units.</p> <p>Service endpoint</p> <p>You can use the following endpoints for Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>https://invoicing.us-east-1.api.aws</code> </p> </li> </ul>",
