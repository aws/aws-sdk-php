  "service": "<fullname>AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate</fullname> <p> A service that runs and manages configuration management servers. </p> <p>Glossary of terms</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A server is a configuration management server, and can be highly-available. The configuration manager runs on your instances by using various AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and potentially Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Engine</b>: The specific configuration manager that you want to use (such as <code>Chef</code>) is the engine.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. A backup creates a .tar.gz file that is stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket in your account. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate creates the S3 bucket when you launch the first instance. A backup maintains a snapshot of all of a server's important attributes at the time of the backup.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>AccountAttributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Throttling limits</p> <p>All API operations allow for 5 requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.</p>",

    "CreateBackup": "<p> Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is <code>BACKING_UP</code>, the server can not be modified and no additional backup can be created. </p> <p> Backups can be created for <code>RUNNING</code>, <code>HEALTHY</code> and <code>UNHEALTHY</code> servers. </p> <p> This operation is asnychronous. </p> <p> By default 50 manual backups can be created. </p> <p> A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown then the maximum number of manual backup is reached. A <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when the server is not in any of RUNNING, HEALTHY, UNHEALTHY. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server is not found. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. </p>",
    "CreateServer": "<p> Creates and immedately starts a new Server. The server can be used once it has reached the <code>HEALTHY</code> state. </p> <p> This operation is asnychronous. </p> <p> A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown then the maximum number of server backup is reached. A <code>ResourceAlreadyExistsException</code> is raise when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when a backupId is passed, but the backup does not exist. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. </p> <p> By default 10 servers can be created. A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is raised when the limit is exceeded. </p> <p> When no security groups are provided by using <code>SecurityGroupIds</code>, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group. This security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, SSH access is enabled. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. </p> <p>By default, the Chef Server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console. </p>",
    "DeleteBackup": "<p> Deletes a backup. You can delete both manual and automated backups. </p> <p> This operation is asynchronous. </p> <p> A <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown then a backup is already deleting.
