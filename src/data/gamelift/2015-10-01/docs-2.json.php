A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated.

To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue\'s default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy\'s maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap.

Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet\'s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet\'s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet\'s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet\'s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet\'s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it\'s successfully created. If the fleet\'s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."</p> <p>A policy\'s rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they\'re successfully created.

For example, an attribute might specify a player\'s skill or level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role. </p> </li> <li> <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul>', 'refs' => [ 'CreateMatchmakingRuleSetOutput$RuleSet' => '<p>The newly created matchmaking rule set.</p>', 'MatchmakingRuleSetList$member' => NULL, ], ], 'MatchmakingRuleSetArn' => [ 'base' => 'Data type used for Matchmaking RuleSet ARN.', 'refs' => [ 'MatchmakingConfiguration$RuleSetArn' => '<p>The Amazon Resource Name (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">ARN</a>) associated with the GameLift matchmaking rule set resource that this configuration uses.</p>', 'MatchmakingRuleSet$RuleSetArn' => '<p>Amazon Resource Name (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">ARN</a>) that is assigned to a GameLift matchmaking rule set resource and uniquely identifies it.
