In response, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in <code>CLAIMED</code> status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server. </p> <p>To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on <code>ACTIVE</code> instances to be claimed.</p> <p>When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the claim status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.</p> <p>If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the game server utilization status is <code>UTILIZED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the game server claim status is <code>CLAIMED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the game server is running on an instance in <code>DRAINING</code> status and the provided filter option does not allow placing on <code>DRAINING</code> instances.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html\">Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>",

In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift Servers supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN.

The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use. </p> </li> <li> <p>An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.</p> <p> <b>Request options</b> </p> <p>Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later.

    "PutScalingPolicy": "<p> <b>This API works with the following fleet types:</b> EC2</p> <p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift Servers to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift Servers to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift Servers to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift Servers will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <code>TargetConfiguration</code> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>",

    "StartGameSessionPlacement": "<p> <b>This API works with the following fleet types:</b> EC2, Anywhere, Container</p> <p>Makes a request to start a new game session using a game session queue. When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift Servers looks for the best possible available resource to host the game session, based on how the queue is configured to prioritize factors such as resource cost, latency, and location. After selecting an available resource, Amazon GameLift Servers prompts the resource to start a game session. A placement request can include a list of players to create a set of player sessions. The request can also include information to pass to the new game session, such as to specify a game map or other options.</p> <p> <b>Request options</b> </p> <p>Use this operation to make the following types of requests. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Request a placement using the queue's default prioritization process (see the default prioritization described in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html\">PriorityConfiguration</a>).

Include a set of latency values for destinations in the queue. When a request includes latency data, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically reorder the queue's locations priority list based on lowest available latency values. If a request includes latency data for multiple players, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates each location's average latency for all players and reorders to find the lowest latency across all players. </p> </li> <li> <p>Don't include <code>PriorityConfigurationOverride</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Prioritize based on a custom list of locations.

You can make all three types of updates in the same request:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To update the game server's utilization status from <code>AVAILABLE</code> (when the game server is available to be claimed) to <code>UTILIZED</code> (when the game server is currently hosting games). Identify the game server and game server group and specify the new utilization status. You can't change the status from to <code>UTILIZED</code> to <code>AVAILABLE</code> .</p> </li> <li> <p>To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to <code>HEALTHY</code>. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html\">Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>",
