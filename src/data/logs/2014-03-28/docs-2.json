For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as \"NullReferenceException\"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as \"404\" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.</p> </li> </ul>",

The account-level policy is applied to existing log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked.</p> <p>By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the <code>logs:Unmask</code> permission can use a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html\">GetLogEvents</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html\">FilterLogEvents</a> operation with the <code>unmask</code> parameter set to <code>true</code> to view the unmasked log events.

You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDataProtectionPolicy.html\">PutDataProtectionPolicy</a> to create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.</p> <p> <b>Subscription filter policy</b> </p> <p>A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services. Account-level subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, and Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.</p> <p>The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.</p> </li> <li> <p>An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.</p> </li> <li> <p>A logical destination in a different account created with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html\">PutDestination</a>, for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy per Region. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in <code>PolicyName</code>. To perform a <code>PutAccountPolicy</code> subscription filter operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission.</p> <p> <b>Transformer policy</b> </p> <p>Creates or updates a <i>log transformer policy</i> for your account. You use log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters.</p> <p>You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.</p> <p>A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors\"> Processors that you can use</a>.</p> <p>Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies.</p> <p>You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.</p> <p>You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the <code>selectionCriteria</code> parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with <code>my-log</code>, you can't have another field index policy filtered to <code>my-logpprod</code> or <code>my-logging</code>.</p> <p>You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html\">PutTransformer</a>. If there is both a log-group level transformer created with <code>PutTransformer</code> and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.</p> <p> <b>Field index policy</b> </p> <p>You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes can help lower the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html\">Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs</a> </p> <p>To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogGroupFields.html\">GetLogGroupFields</a> operation.</p> <p>For example, suppose you have created a field index for <code>requestId</code>. Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes <code>requestId = <i>value</i> </code> or <code>requestId in [<i>value</i>, <i>value</i>, ...]</code> will attempt to process only the log events where the indexed field matches the specified value.</p> <p>Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, an indexed field of <code>RequestId</code> won't match a log event containing <code>requestId</code>.</p> <p>You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the <code>selectionCriteria</code> parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with <code>my-log</code>, you can't have another field index policy filtered to <code>my-logpprod</code> or <code>my-logging</code>.</p> <p>If you create an account-level field index policy in a monitoring account in cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring account and not to any source accounts.</p> <p>If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutIndexPolicy.html\">PutIndexPolicy</a> instead of <code>PutAccountPolicy</code>. If you do so, that log group will use only that log-group level policy, and will ignore the account-level policy that you create with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html\">PutAccountPolicy</a>.</p>",

Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are deleted. </p> <p>When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After they are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if they are not actually deleted until later.

This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.</p> <p>A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. The processors work one after another, in the order that you list them, like a pipeline.
