By default, all locations have 1 or 2 capacity, depending on the stream class option: 2 for \'High\' and 1 for \'Ultra\' and \'Win2022\'.

A stream group is a collection of resources that Amazon GameLift Streams uses to stream your application to end-users. When you create a stream group, you specify an application to stream by default and the type of hardware to use, such as the graphical processing unit (GPU). You can also link additional applications, which allows you to stream those applications using this stream group. Depending on your expected users, you also scale the number of concurrent streams you want to support at one time, and in what locations. </p> <p> Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. There are two types of capacity, always-on and on-demand: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Always-on</b>: The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it\'s in use or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming session. Default is 1 when creating a stream group or adding a location. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>On-demand</b>: The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location. </p> </li> </ul> <p> To adjust the capacity of any <code>ACTIVE</code> stream group, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html">UpdateStreamGroup</a>. </p> <p> If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins creating the stream group.
