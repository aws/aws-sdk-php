You configure locations and their corresponding capacity for each stream group. Creating a stream group in a location that's nearest to your end users can help minimize latency and improve quality. </p> <p> This operation provisions stream capacity at the specified locations. By default, all locations have 1 or 2 capacity, depending on the stream class option: 2 for 'High' and 1 for 'Ultra' and 'Win2022'. This operation also copies the content files of all associated applications to an internal S3 bucket at each location. This allows Amazon GameLift Streams to host performant stream sessions. </p>",
    "AssociateApplications": "<p>When you associate, or link, an application with a stream group, then Amazon GameLift Streams can launch the application using the stream group's allocated compute resources. The stream group must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status. You can reverse this action by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DisassociateApplications.html\">DisassociateApplications</a>.</p> <p>If a stream group does not already have a linked application, Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically assign the first application provided in <code>ApplicationIdentifiers</code> as the default.</p>",

For more information, see <b>Getting Started</b> in the Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide. </p> <important> <p> Make sure that your files in the Amazon S3 bucket are the correct version you want to use. If you change the files at a later time, you will need to create a new Amazon GameLift Streams application. </p> </important> <p> If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins to create an application and sets the status to <code>INITIALIZED</code>. When an application reaches <code>READY</code> status, you can use the application to set up stream groups and start streams. To track application status, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetApplication.html\">GetApplication</a>. </p>",
    "CreateStreamGroup": "<p> Stream groups manage how Amazon GameLift Streams allocates resources and handles concurrent streams, allowing you to effectively manage capacity and costs. Within a stream group, you specify an application to stream, streaming locations and their capacity, and the stream class you want to use when streaming applications to your end-users. A stream class defines the hardware configuration of the compute resources that Amazon GameLift Streams will use when streaming, such as the CPU, GPU, and memory. </p> <p> Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. There are two types of capacity, always-on and on-demand: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Always-on</b>: The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming session. Default is 1 (2 for high stream classes) when creating a stream group or adding a location. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>On-demand</b>: The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.</p> <p> To adjust the capacity of any <code>ACTIVE</code> stream group, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html\">UpdateStreamGroup</a>. </p> <p> If the <code>CreateStreamGroup</code> request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams assigns a unique ID to the stream group resource and sets the status to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. It can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to finish creating the stream group while it searches for unallocated compute resources and provisions them. When complete, the stream group status will be <code>ACTIVE</code> and you can start stream sessions by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_StartStreamSession.html\">StartStreamSession</a>. To check the stream group's status, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamGroup.html\">GetStreamGroup</a>. </p> <p>Stream groups should be recreated every 3-4 weeks to pick up important service updates and fixes. Stream groups that are older than 180 days can no longer be updated with new application associations. Stream groups expire when they are 365 days old, at which point they can no longer stream sessions. The exact expiration date is indicated by the date value in the <code>ExpiresAt</code> field.</p>",
    "CreateStreamSessionConnection": "<p>Enables clients to reconnect to a stream session while preserving all session state and data in the disconnected session.

    "DisassociateApplications": "<p> When you disassociate, or unlink, an application from a stream group, you can no longer stream this application by using that stream group's allocated compute resources. Any streams in process will continue until they terminate, which helps avoid interrupting an end-user's stream.

To disassociate an application, the stream group must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status. </p> <p> If you disassociate the default application, Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically choose a new default application from the remaining associated applications. To change which application is the default application, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html\">UpdateStreamGroup</a> and specify a new <code>DefaultApplicationIdentifier</code>. </p>",

When your application runs, it generates output files such as logs, diagnostic information, crash dumps, save files, user data, screenshots, and so on.

You must provide an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store the files in.
