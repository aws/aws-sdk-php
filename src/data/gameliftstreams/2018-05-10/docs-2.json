  "operations": {
    "AddStreamGroupLocations": "<p> Add locations that can host stream sessions. You configure locations and their corresponding capacity for each stream group. Creating a stream group in a location that's nearest to your end users can help minimize latency and improve quality. </p> <p> This operation provisions stream capacity at the specified locations. By default, all locations have 1 or 2 capacity, depending on the stream class option: 2 for 'High' and 1 for 'Ultra' and 'Win2022'. This operation also copies the content files of all associated applications to an internal S3 bucket at each location. This allows Amazon GameLift Streams to host performant stream sessions. </p>",
    "AssociateApplications": "<p>When you associate, or link, an application with a stream group, then Amazon GameLift Streams can launch the application using the stream group's allocated compute resources. The stream group must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status. You can reverse this action by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DisassociateApplications.html\">DisassociateApplications</a>.</p>",
    "CreateApplication": "<p>Creates an application resource in Amazon GameLift Streams, which specifies the application content you want to stream, such as a game build or other software, and configures the settings to run it.</p> <p> Before you create an application, upload your application content files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see <b>Getting Started</b> in the Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide. </p> <important> <p> Make sure that your files in the Amazon S3 bucket are the correct version you want to use. If you change the files at a later time, you will need to create a new Amazon GameLift Streams application. </p> </important> <p> If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins to create an application and sets the status to <code>INITIALIZED</code>. When an application reaches <code>READY</code> status, you can use the application to set up stream groups and start streams. To track application status, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetApplication.html\">GetApplication</a>. </p>",
    "CreateStreamGroup": "<p> Manage how Amazon GameLift Streams streams your applications by using a stream group. A stream group is a collection of resources that Amazon GameLift Streams uses to stream your application to end-users. When you create a stream group, you specify an application to stream by default and the type of hardware to use, such as the graphical processing unit (GPU). You can also link additional applications, which allows you to stream those applications using this stream group. Depending on your expected users, you also scale the number of concurrent streams you want to support at one time, and in what locations. </p> <p> Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. There are two types of capacity, always-on and on-demand: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Always-on</b>: The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming session. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>On-demand</b>: The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). </p> </li> </ul> <p> To adjust the capacity of any <code>ACTIVE</code> stream group, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html\">UpdateStreamGroup</a>. </p> <p> If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins creating the stream group. Amazon GameLift Streams assigns a unique ID to the stream group resource and sets the status to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. When the stream group reaches <code>ACTIVE</code> status, you can start stream sessions by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_StartStreamSession.html\">StartStreamSession</a>. To check the stream group's status, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamGroup.html\">GetStreamGroup</a>. </p>",
    "CreateStreamSessionConnection": "<p>Allows clients to reconnect to a recently disconnected stream session without losing any data from the last session.</p> <p>A client can reconnect to a stream session that's in <code>PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION</code> or <code>ACTIVE</code> status. In the stream session life cycle, when the client disconnects from the stream session, the stream session transitions from <code>CONNECTED</code> to <code>PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION</code> status. When a client requests to reconnect by calling <code>CreateStreamSessionConnection</code>, the stream session transitions to <code>RECONNECTING</code> status. When the reconnection is successful, the stream session transitions to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. After a stream session is disconnected for longer than <code>ConnectionTimeoutSeconds</code>, the stream session transitions to the <code>TERMINATED</code> status.</p> <p>To connect to an existing stream session, specify the stream group ID and stream session ID that you want to reconnect to, as well as the signal request settings to use with the stream.</p> <p> <code>ConnectionTimeoutSeconds</code> defines the amount of time after the stream session disconnects that a reconnection is allowed. If a client is disconnected from the stream for longer than <code>ConnectionTimeoutSeconds</code>, the stream session ends.</p>",
    "DeleteApplication": "<p>Permanently deletes an Amazon GameLift Streams application resource. This also deletes the application content files stored with Amazon GameLift Streams. However, this does not delete the original files that you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket; you can delete these any time after Amazon GameLift Streams creates an application, which is the only time Amazon GameLift Streams accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <p> You can only delete an application that meets the following conditions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The application is in <code>READY</code> or <code>ERROR</code> status. You cannot delete an application that's in <code>PROCESSING</code> or <code>INITIALIZED</code> status.</p> </li> <li> <p>The application is not the default application of any stream groups.

    "DeleteStreamGroup": "<p>Permanently deletes all compute resources and information related to a stream group. To delete a stream group, specify the unique stream group identifier. During the deletion process, the stream group's status is <code>DELETING</code>. This operation stops streams in progress and prevents new streams from starting. As a best practice, before deleting the stream group, call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_ListStreamSessions.html\">ListStreamSessions</a> to check for streams in progress and take action to stop them. When you delete a stream group, any application associations referring to that stream group are automatically removed.</p>",
    "DisassociateApplications": "<p> When you disassociate, or unlink, an application from a stream group, you can no longer stream this application by using that stream group's allocated compute resources. Any streams in process will continue until they terminate, which helps avoid interrupting an end-user's stream. Amazon GameLift Streams will not initiate new streams using this stream group. The disassociate action does not affect the stream capacity of a stream group. </p> <p> You can only disassociate an application if it's not a default application of the stream group.

    "ExportStreamSessionFiles": "<p> Export the files that your application modifies or generates in a stream session, which can help you debug or verify your application. When your application runs, it generates output files such as logs, diagnostic information, crash dumps, save files, user data, screenshots, and so on. The files can be defined by the engine or frameworks that your application uses, or information that you've programmed your application to output. </p> <p> You can only call this action on a stream session that is in progress, specifically in one of the following statuses <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>CONNECTED</code>, <code>PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION</code>, and <code>RECONNECTING</code>. You must provide an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store the files in. When the session ends, Amazon GameLift Streams produces a compressed folder that contains all of the files and directories that were modified or created by the application during the stream session. AWS uses your security credentials to authenticate and authorize access to your Amazon S3 bucket. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift Streams collects the following generated and modified files. Find them in the corresponding folders in the <code>.zip</code> archive.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>application/</code>: The folder where your application or game is stored. </p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p> <code>profile/</code>: The user profile folder.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>temp/</code>: The system temp folder.</p> </li> </ul> <p/> <p>To verify the status of the exported files, use GetStreamSession. </p> <p>To delete the files, delete the object in the S3 bucket. </p>",

    "RemoveStreamGroupLocations": "<p> Removes a set of remote locations from this stream group. Amazon GameLift Streams works to release allocated compute resources in these location. Thus, stream sessions can no longer start from these locations by using this stream group. Amazon GameLift Streams also deletes the content files of all associated applications that were in Amazon GameLift Streams's internal S3 bucket at this location. </p> <p> You cannot remove the region where you initially created this stream group, known as the primary location. However, you can set the stream capacity to zero. </p>",
    "StartStreamSession": "<p> This action initiates a new stream session and outputs connection information that clients can use to access the stream. A stream session refers to an instance of a stream that Amazon GameLift Streams transmits from the server to the end-user. A stream session runs on a compute resource that a stream group has allocated. </p> <p>To start a new stream session, specify a stream group and application ID, along with the transport protocol and signal request settings to use with the stream. You must have associated at least one application to the stream group before starting a stream session, either when creating the stream group, or by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AssociateApplications.html\">AssociateApplications</a>.</p> <p> For stream groups that have multiple locations, provide a set of locations ordered by priority using a <code>Locations</code> parameter. Amazon GameLift Streams will start a single stream session in the next available location. An application must be finished replicating in a remote location before the remote location can host a stream. </p> <p> If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins to prepare the stream. Amazon GameLift Streams assigns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value to the stream session resource and sets the status to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. During the stream preparation process, Amazon GameLift Streams queues the request and searches for available stream capacity to run the stream. This results in one of the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Amazon GameLift Streams identifies an available compute resource to run the application content and start the stream. When the stream is ready, the stream session's status changes to <code>ACTIVE</code> and includes stream connection information. Provide the connection information to the requesting client to join the stream session.</p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon GameLift Streams doesn't identify an available resource within a certain time, set by <code>ClientToken</code>.
