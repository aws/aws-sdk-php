EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies running analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With EMR Serverless, you donâ€™t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run applications with these frameworks.</p> <p>The API reference to Amazon EMR Serverless is <code>emr-serverless</code>. The <code>emr-serverless</code> prefix is used in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>aws emr-serverless start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>"Action": ["emr-serverless:StartJobRun"]</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions">Policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR Serverless service endpoints.
