  "service": "<p><note> <p>This guide is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage resources in MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from May 2023. To get started with MediaPackage v2, create your MediaPackage resources. There isn't an automated process to migrate your resources from MediaPackage v1 to MediaPackage v2. </p> <p>The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like URLs and ARNs, all have the versioning information added, like &quot;v2&quot;, to distinguish from the prior version. If you used MediaPackage prior to this release, you can't use the MediaPackage v2 CLI or the MediaPackage v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1 resources.</p> <p>If you created resources in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand (VOD) workflows, and aren't looking to migrate to MediaPackage v2 yet, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/apireference/what-is.html\">MediaPackage v1 Live API Reference</a>.</p> </note> <p>This is the AWS Elemental MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It describes all the MediaPackage API operations for live content in detail, and provides sample requests, responses, and errors for the supported web services protocols.</p> <p>We assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use MediaPackage via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the features and operations of MediaPackage, as described in the AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide.</p></p>",
  "operations": {
    "CancelHarvestJob": "<p>Cancels an in-progress harvest job.</p>",
    "CreateChannel": "<p>Create a channel to start receiving content streams. The channel represents the input to MediaPackage for incoming live content from an encoder such as AWS Elemental MediaLive. The channel receives content, and after packaging it, outputs it through an origin endpoint to downstream devices (such as video players or CDNs) that request the content. You can create only one channel with each request. We recommend that you spread out channels between channel groups, such as putting redundant channels in the same AWS Region in different channel groups.</p>",
    "CreateChannelGroup": "<p>Create a channel group to group your channels and origin endpoints. A channel group is the top-level resource that consists of channels and origin endpoints that are associated with it and that provides predictable URLs for stream delivery. All channels and origin endpoints within the channel group are guaranteed to share the DNS. You can create only one channel group with each request. </p>",
    "CreateHarvestJob": "<p>Creates a new harvest job to export content from a MediaPackage v2 channel to an S3 bucket.</p>",
    "CreateOriginEndpoint": "<p>The endpoint is attached to a channel, and represents the output of the live content. You can associate multiple endpoints to a single channel. Each endpoint gives players and downstream CDNs (such as Amazon CloudFront) access to the content for playback. Content can't be served from a channel until it has an endpoint. You can create only one endpoint with each request. </p>",
    "DeleteChannel": "<p>Delete a channel to stop AWS Elemental MediaPackage from receiving further content. You must delete the channel's origin endpoints before you can delete the channel.</p>",
    "DeleteChannelGroup": "<p>Delete a channel group. You must delete the channel group's channels and origin endpoints before you can delete the channel group. If you delete a channel group, you'll lose access to the egress domain and will have to create a new channel group to replace it.</p>",
    "DeleteChannelPolicy": "<p>Delete a channel policy.</p>",
    "DeleteOriginEndpoint": "<p>Origin endpoints can serve content until they're deleted. Delete the endpoint if it should no longer respond to playback requests. You must delete all endpoints from a channel before you can delete the channel.</p>",
    "DeleteOriginEndpointPolicy": "<p>Delete an origin endpoint policy.</p>",
    "GetChannel": "<p>Retrieves the specified channel that's configured in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.</p>",
    "GetChannelGroup": "<p>Retrieves the specified channel group that's configured in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.</p>",
    "GetChannelPolicy": "<p>Retrieves the specified channel policy that's configured in AWS Elemental MediaPackage. With policies, you can specify who has access to AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources.</p>",
    "GetHarvestJob": "<p>Retrieves the details of a specific harvest job.</p>",

    "PutOriginEndpointPolicy": "<p>Attaches an IAM policy to the specified origin endpoint. You can attach only one policy with each request.</p>",
    "ResetChannelState": "<p>Resetting the channel can help to clear errors from misconfigurations in the encoder. A reset refreshes the ingest stream and removes previous content. </p> <p> Be sure to stop the encoder before you reset the channel, and wait at least 30 seconds before you restart the encoder. </p>",
    "ResetOriginEndpointState": "<p>Resetting the origin endpoint can help to resolve unexpected behavior and other content packaging issues. It also helps to preserve special events when you don't want the previous content to be available for viewing. A reset clears out all previous content from the origin endpoint.</p> <p>MediaPackage might return old content from this endpoint in the first 30 seconds after the endpoint reset. For best results, when possible, wait 30 seconds from endpoint reset to send playback requests to this endpoint. </p>",
    "TagResource": "<p>Assigns one of more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified MediaPackage resource.</p> <p>Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the TagResource operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.</p>",
    "UntagResource": "<p>Removes one or more tags from the specified resource.</p>",
    "UpdateChannel": "<p>Update the specified channel. You can edit if MediaPackage sends ingest or egress access logs to the CloudWatch log group, if content will be encrypted, the description on a channel, and your channel's policy settings. You can't edit the name of the channel or CloudFront distribution details.</p> <p>Any edits you make that impact the video output may not be reflected for a few minutes.</p>",
    "UpdateChannelGroup": "<p>Update the specified channel group. You can edit the description on a channel group for easier identification later from the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console. You can't edit the name of the channel group.</p> <p>Any edits you make that impact the video output may not be reflected for a few minutes.</p>",
    "UpdateOriginEndpoint": "<p>Update the specified origin endpoint. Edit the packaging preferences on an endpoint to optimize the viewing experience. You can't edit the name of the endpoint.</p> <p>Any edits you make that impact the video output may not be reflected for a few minutes.</p>"
