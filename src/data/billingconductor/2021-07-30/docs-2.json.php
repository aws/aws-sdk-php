Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn\'t change the way you\'re billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing">Amazon Web Services Billing console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per billing group.</p> <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/">Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/what-is-billingconductor.html"> Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide</a>.</p>', 'operations' => [ 'AssociateAccounts' => '<p>Connects an array of account IDs in a consolidated billing family to a predefined billing group.
