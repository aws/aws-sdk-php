The Snowball commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html\">User Guide</a>.</p>",

The manifest is decrypted by using the <code>UnlockCode</code> code value, when you pass both values to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.</p> <p>As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an <code>UnlockCode</code> value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job.</p> <p>Note that the credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 90 days after the job is created.</p>",
