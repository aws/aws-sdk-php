return [ 'version' => '2.0', 'service' => '<p>AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by enabling you to identify any policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your AWS environment. An external principal can be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an AWS service, or an anonymous user. You can also use Access Analyzer to preview and validate public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes. This guide describes the AWS IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically.
