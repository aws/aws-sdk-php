Feature: S3 Transfer Manager
  S3 Transfer Manager should successfully do:
  - object uploads
  - object multipart uploads
  - object downloads
  - object multipart downloads
  - directory object uploads
  - directory object downloads

  Scenario Outline: Successfully does a single file upload
    Given I have a file <filename> with content <content>
    When I upload the file <filename> to a test bucket using the s3 transfer manager
    Then the file <filename> should exist in the test bucket and its content should be <content>

    Examples:
      | filename                | content         |
      | myfile-test-1-1.txt     | Test content #1 |
      | myfile-test-1-2.txt     | Test content #2 |
      | myfile-test-1-3.txt     | Test content #3 |


  Scenario Outline: Successfully does a single upload from a stream
    Given I have a stream with content <content>
    When I do the upload to a test bucket with key <key>
    Then the object <key>, once downloaded from the test bucket, should match the content <content>
    Examples:
      | content                   | key                     |
      | "This is a test text - 1" | myfile-test-2-1.txt     |
      | "This is a test text - 2" | myfile-test-2-2.txt     |
      | "This is a test text - 3" | myfile-test-2-3.txt     |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully do multipart object upload from file
    Given I have a file with name <filename> where its content's size is <filesize>
    When I do upload this file with name <filename> with the specified part size of <partsize>
    Then the object with name <filename> should have a total of <partnum> parts and its size must be <filesize>
    Examples:
      | filename                | filesize | partsize | partnum |
      | myfile-test-3-1.txt     | 10485760 | 5242880  | 2       |
      | myfile-test-3-2.txt     | 24117248 | 5242880  | 5       |
      | myfile-test-3-3.txt     | 24117248 | 8388608  | 3       |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully do multipart object upload from streams
    Given I want to upload a stream of size <filesize>
    When I do upload this stream with name <filename> and the specified part size of <partsize>
    Then the object with name <filename> should have a total of <partnum> parts and its size must be <filesize>
    Examples:
      | filename                | filesize | partsize | partnum |
      | myfile-test-4-1.txt     | 10485760 | 5242880  | 2       |
      | myfile-test-4-2.txt     | 24117248 | 5242880  | 5       |
      | myfile-test-4-3.txt     | 24117248 | 8388608  | 3       |

  Scenario Outline: Does single object upload with custom checksum
    Given I have a file with name <filename> and its content is <content>
    When I upload this file with name <filename> by providing a custom checksum algorithm <checksum_algorithm>
    Then the checksum from the object with name <filename> should be equals to the calculation of the object content with the checksum algorithm <checksum_algorithm>
    Examples:
      | filename                | content                            | checksum_algorithm |
      | myfile-test-5-1.txt     | This is a test file content #1     | crc32              |
      | myfile-test-5-2.txt     | This is a test file content #2     | crc32c             |
      | myfile-test-5-3.txt     | This is a test file content #3     | sha256             |
      | myfile-test-5-4.txt     | This is a test file content #4     | sha1               |

  Scenario Outline: Does single object download
    Given I have an object in S3 with name <filename> and its content is <content>
    When I do a download of the object with name <filename>
    Then the object with name <filename> should have been downloaded and its content should be <content>
    Examples:
      | filename                | content                            |
      | myfile-test-6-1.txt     | This is a test file content #1    |
      | myfile-test-6-2.txt     | This is a test file content #2    |
      | myfile-test-6-3.txt     | This is a test file content #3    |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully does multipart object download
    Given I have an object in S3 with name <filename> and its size is <filesize>
    When I download the object with name <filename> by using the <download_type> multipart download type
    Then the content size for the object with name <filename> should be <filesize>
    Examples:
      | filename                | filesize  | download_type |
      | myfile-test-7-1.txt     | 20971520  | ranged        |
      | myfile-test-7-2.txt     | 28311552  | ranged        |
      | myfile-test-7-3.txt     | 12582912  | ranged        |
      | myfile-test-7-4.txt     | 20971520  | part          |
      | myfile-test-7-5.txt     | 28311552  | part          |
      | myfile-test-7-6.txt     | 12582912  | part          |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully does directory upload
    Given I have a directory <directory> with <numfile> files that I want to upload
    When I upload this directory <directory>
    Then the files from this directory <directory> where its count should be <numfile> should exist in the bucket
    Examples:
      | directory              | numfile |
      | directory-test-1-1     | 10      |
      | directory-test-1-2     | 3       |
      | directory-test-1-3     | 25      |
      | directory-test-1-4     | 1       |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully does a directory download
    Given I have a total of <numfile> objects in a bucket prefixed with <directory>
    When I download all of them into the directory <directory>
    Then the objects <numfile> should exist as files within the directory <directory>
    Examples:
      | numfile | directory              |
      | 15      | directory-test-2-1     |
      | 12      | directory-test-2-2     |
      | 1       | directory-test-2-3     |
      | 30      | directory-test-2-4     |

  Scenario Outline: Abort a multipart upload
    Given I am uploading the file <file> with size <size>
    When I upload the file <file> using multipart upload and fails at part number <partNumberFail>
    Then The multipart upload should have been aborted for file <file>
    Examples:
      | file               | size     | partNumberFail |
      | abort-file-1.txt   | 20971520 | 3              |
      | abort-file-2.txt   | 41943040 | 5              |
