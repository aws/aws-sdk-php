AWS KMS is a service that combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide a key management system scaled for the cloud. AWS KMS is used via the AWS Management Console or APIs to centrally create encryption keys, define the policies that control how keys can be used, and audit key usage to prove they are being used correctly. For more information, see the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
