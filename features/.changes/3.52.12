The values prior to this update did not represent appropriate values returned by GetResourceConfigHistory. You must update your code to enumerate the new enum values so this is a breaking change. To map old properties to new properties, use the following descriptions: New discovered resource - Old property: Discovered, New property: ResourceDiscovered. Updated resource - Old property: Ok, New property: OK. Deleted resource - Old property: Deleted, New property: ResourceDeleted or ResourceDeletedNotRecorded. Not-recorded resource - Old property: N\/A, New property: ResourceNotRecorded or ResourceDeletedNotRecorded."
