        "description": "A new `params` option is available in the `MultipartUploader` and `MultipartCopy` classes for parameters that should be applied to all sub-commands of their upload functionality. This also improves functionality around passing `params` directly to `ObjectUploader` and `ObjectCopier`. A new `before_lookup` callback has been added to `ObjectCopier` for operating on the `HeadObject` command directly; `params` will be passed to HeadObject as well. Since these are changes to existing options, they may alter current functionality."
