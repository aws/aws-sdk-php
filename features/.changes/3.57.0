The slow start mode can be used to gradually increase the number of requests forwarded by a load balancer to a newly added target in a target group. It provides a new target an opportunity to warm up before it can handle its fair share of requests received from the load balancer. Slow start mode is disabled by default and can be enabled on a per target group basis."
