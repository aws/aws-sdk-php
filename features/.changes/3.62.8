You can also choose to roll back to a previous version. The two new APIs added for managing cluster release version are - ModifyClusterDbRevision, DescribeClusterDbRevisions. Feature 2 - Upgradeable reserved instance - You can now exchange one Reserved Instance for a new Reserved Instance with no changes to the terms of your existing Reserved Instance (term, payment type, or number of nodes). The two new APIs added for managing these upgrades are - AcceptReservedNodeExchange, GetReservedNodeExchangeOfferings. "
