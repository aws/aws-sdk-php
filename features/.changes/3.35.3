The Descriptions for Security Group Rules feature supports one description field per Security Group rule for both ingress and egress rules . Descriptions for Security Group Rules provides a simple way to describe the purpose or function of a Security Group Rule allowing for easier customer identification of configuration elements . Prior to the release of Descriptions for Security Group Rules , customers had to maintain a separate system outside of AWS if they wanted to track Security Group Rule mapping and their purpose for being implemented. If a security group rule has already been created and you would like to update or change your description for that security group rule you can use the UpdateSecurityGroupRuleDescription API."
