With this launch, you can offload the decryption\/encryption of TLS traffic from your application servers to the Network Load Balancer. This enables you to run your backend servers optimally and keep your workloads secure. Additionally, Network Load Balancers preserve the source IP of the clients to the back-end applications, while terminating TLS on the load balancer. When TLS is enabled on an NLB, Access Logs can be enabled for the load balancer, and log entries will be emitted for all TLS connections."
