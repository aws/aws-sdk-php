Now, when a table with PITR enabled is deleted, a system backup is automatically created and retained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System backups allow you to restore the deleted PITR enabled table to the state it was just before the point of deletion. For more information, see the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
