An Amazon ECS deployment uses an Elastic Load Balancer, two Amazon ECS target groups, and a listener to reroute production traffic from your Amazon ECS service's original task set to a new replacement task set. The original task set is terminated when the deployment is complete. Success of a deployment can be validated using Lambda functions that are referenced by the deployment. This provides the opportunity to rollback if necessary. You can use the new ECSService, ECSTarget, and ECSTaskSet data types in the updated SDK to create or retrieve an Amazon ECS deployment."
