Prior to this, custom format VPC flow logs enriched with additional metadata could be published only to S3. With this launch, we are also adding additional metadata fields that provide insights about the location such as AWS Region, AWS Availability Zone, AWS Local Zone, AWS Wavelength Zone, or AWS Outpost where the network interface where flow logs are captured exists.
