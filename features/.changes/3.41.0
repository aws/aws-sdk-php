You are now also able to create endpoints to other services powered by PrivateLink including AWS services, Marketplace Seller services or custom services created by yourself or other AWS VPC customers. 2. You are now able to save launch parameters in a single template that can be used with Auto Scaling, Spot Fleet, Spot, and On Demand instances. 3. You are now able to launch Spot instances via the RunInstances API, using a single additional parameter. RunInstances will response synchronously with an instance ID should capacity be available for your Spot request. 4. A simplified Spot pricing model which delivers low, predictable prices that adjust gradually, based on long-term trends in supply and demand. 5. Amazon EC2 Spot can now hibernate Amazon EBS-backed instances in the event of an interruption, so your workloads pick up from where they left off. Spot can fulfill your request by resuming instances from a hibernated state when capacity is available."
