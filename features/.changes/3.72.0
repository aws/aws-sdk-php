Automated snapshots can be scheduled to be taken at a custom interval and the schedule created can be reused across clusters. Manual snapshot retention periods can be set at the cluster, snapshot, and cross-region-copy level. The retention period set on a manual snapshot indicates how many days the snapshot will be retained before being automatically deleted."
