Also, the fileExistsBehavior parameter has been added for CreateDeployment action requests. In the past, if the AWS CodeDeploy agent detected files in a target location that weren't part of the application revision from the most recent successful deployment, it would fail the current deployment by default. This new parameter provides options for how the agent handles these files: fail the deployment, retain the content, or overwrite the content."
