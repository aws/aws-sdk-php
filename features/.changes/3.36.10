Your Spot request can be fulfilled again by restarting instances from a previously stopped state, subject to availability of capacity at or below your preferred price. When you submit a persistent Spot request, you can choose from \"terminate\" or \"stop\" as the instance interruption behavior. Choosing \"stop\" will shutdown your Spot instances so you can continue from this stopped state later on. This feature is only available for instances with Amazon EBS volume as their root device."
