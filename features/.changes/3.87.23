        "description": "This release updates AWS Systems Manager APIs to support service settings for AWS customers. A service setting is a key-value pair that defines how a user interacts with or uses an AWS service, and is typically created and consumed by the AWS service team. AWS customers can read a service setting via GetServiceSetting API and update the setting via UpdateServiceSetting API or ResetServiceSetting API, which are introduced in this release. For example, if an AWS service charges money to the account based on a feature or service usage, then the AWS service team might create a setting with the default value of \"false\". This means the user can't use this feature unless they update the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature."

Users can also specify tags to be attached to these resources during their creation. Describe and list operations on these resources will now additionally return any tags associated with them."
