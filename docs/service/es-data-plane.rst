Signing an Amazon Elasticsearch Service Search Request
======================================================

Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) is a managed service that makes it easy
to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch, a popular open-source search and
analytics engine. Amazon ES offers direct access to the Elasticsearch API,
meaning that developers can use the tools with which theyâ€™re familiar, as well
as robust security options, such as using IAM users and roles for access
control. Many Elasticsearch clients support request signing, but if you're using
a client that doesn't, you can sign arbitrary PSR-7 requests with the SDK's
built-in credential providers and signers.

Signing an Amazon ES Request
----------------------------

Amazon ES uses `Signature Version 4 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`_,
which means that you will need to sign requests against the service's signing
name (``es``, in this case) and the region of your Amazon ES domain. A full list
of regions supported by Amazon ES can be found `on AWS's Regions and Endpoints
page <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticsearch-service-regions>`_,
but in this sample, I'll be signing requests against an Amazon ES domain in the
``us-west-2`` region.

You'll need to provide credentials, which can be done either with the SDK's
default provider chain or any any form of credentials described in
:doc:`../guide/credentials`, as well as a `PSR-7 request
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Psr.Http.Message.RequestInterface.html>`_
(assumed in the code below to be named ``$psr7Request``):

.. code-block:: php

    // Pull credentials from the default provider chain
    $provider = Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::defaultProvider();
    $credentials = call_user_func($provider)->wait();

    // Create a signer with the service's signing name and region
    $signer = new Aws\Signature\SignatureV4('es', 'us-west-2');

    // Sign your request
    $signedRequest = $signer->signRequest($psr7Request, $credentials);
