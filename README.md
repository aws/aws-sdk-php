The **AWS SDK for PHP** enables PHP developers to use [Amazon Web Services][aws]
in their PHP code, and build robust applications and software using services
like Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, etc. You can get started in
minutes by [installing the SDK through Composer][docs-installation] or by
downloading a single zip or phar file from our [latest release][latest-release].

## Features

* Provides easy-to-use HTTP clients for all supported AWS
  [services][docs-services], [regions][docs-rande], and authentication
  protocols.
* Is built for PHP 5.3.3+ and is compliant with [PSR-0], [PSR-1], and [PSR-2].
* Is easy to install through [Composer][install-packagist], or by downloading
  the phar or zip file of our [latest release][latest-release].
* Is built on [Guzzle v3][guzzle], and utilizes many of its features, including
  persistent connections, parallel requests, events and plugins
  (via [Symfony2 EventDispatcher][symfony2-events]), service descriptions,
  [over-the-wire logging][docs-wire-logging], caching, flexible batching, and
  request retrying with truncated exponential backoff.
* Provides convenience features including easy response pagination via
  [Iterators][docs-iterators], resource [Waiters][docs-waiters], and simple
  [modelled responses][docs-models].
* Allows you to [sync local directories to Amazon S3 buckets][docs-s3-sync].
* Provides a [multipart uploader tool][docs-s3-multipart] for Amazon S3 and
  Amazon Glacier that can be paused and resumed.
* Provides an [Amazon S3 Stream Wrapper][docs-streamwrapper], so that you can
  use PHP's native file handling functions to interact with your S3 buckets and
  objects like a local filesystem.
* Provides the [Amazon DynamoDB Session Handler][docs-ddbsh] for easily scaling
  sessions on a fast, NoSQL database.
* Automatically uses [IAM Instance Profile Credentials][aws-iam-credentials] on
  configured Amazon EC2 instances.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up for AWS** – Before you begin, you need to
   [sign up for an AWS account][docs-signup] and retrieve your AWS credentials.
1. **Minimum requirements** – To run the SDK, your system will need to meet the
   [minimum requirements][docs-requirements], including having **PHP 5.3.3+**
   compiled with the cURL extension and cURL 7.16.2+ compiled with OpenSSL and
   zlib.
1. **Install the SDK** – Using [Composer] is the recommended way to install the
   AWS SDK for PHP. The SDK is available via [Packagist] under the
   [`aws/aws-sdk-php`][install-packagist] package. Please see the
   [Installation section of the User Guide][docs-installation] for more
   detailed information about installing the SDK through Composer and other
   means.
1. **Using the SDK** – The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK
   is to read the [User Guide][docs-guide]. The
   [Getting Started Guide][docs-quickstart] will help you become familiar with
   the basic concepts, and there are also specific guides for each of the
   [supported services][docs-services].

## Quick Example

### Upload a File to Amazon S3

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;
use Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception;

// Instantiate an S3 client
$s3 = S3Client::factory();

// Upload a publicly accessible file. The file size, file type, and MD5 hash
// are automatically calculated by the SDK.
try {
    $s3->putObject(array(
        'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
        'Key'    => 'my-object',
        'Body'   => fopen('/path/to/file', 'r'),
        'ACL'    => 'public-read',
    ));
} catch (S3Exception $e) {
    echo "There was an error uploading the file.\n";
}
```

You can also use the even easier `upload()` method, which will automatically do
either single or multipart uploads, as needed.

```php
try {
    $resource = fopen('/path/to/file', 'r');
    $s3->upload('my-bucket', 'my-object', $resource, 'public-read');
} catch (S3Exception $e) {
    echo "There was an error uploading the file.\n";
}
```

* [Upload a large file to Amazon S3 in parts][example-s3-multipart]
* [Put an item in your Amazon DynamoDB table][example-dynamodb-putitem]
* [Send a message to your Amazon SQS queue][example-sqs-sendmessage]
