The **AWS SDK for PHP** makes it easy for developers to access [Amazon Web
Services][aws] in their PHP code, and build robust applications and software
using services like Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, etc. You can
get started in minutes by [installing the SDK through Composer][docs-installation]
or by downloading a single zip or phar file from our [latest release][latest-release].

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up for AWS** – Before you begin, you need to
   sign up for an AWS account and retrieve your [AWS credentials][docs-signup].
2. **Minimum requirements** – To run the SDK, your system will need to meet the
   [minimum requirements][docs-requirements], including having **PHP >= 8.1**.
   We highly recommend having it compiled with the cURL extension and cURL
   7.16.2+ compiled with a TLS backend (e.g., NSS or OpenSSL).
3. **Install the SDK** – Using [Composer] is the recommended way to install the
   AWS SDK for PHP. The SDK is available via [Packagist] under the
   [`aws/aws-sdk-php`][install-packagist] package. If Composer is installed globally on your system, you can run the following in the base directory of your project to add the SDK as a dependency:
   ```
   composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
   ```
   Please see the
   [Installation section of the User Guide][docs-installation] for more
   detailed information about installing the SDK through Composer and other
   means.
4. **Using the SDK** – The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK
   is to read the [User Guide][docs-guide]. The
   [Getting Started Guide][docs-quickstart] will help you become familiar with
   the basic concepts.
5. **Beta: Removing unused services** — To date, there are over 300 AWS services available for use with this SDK.
   You will likely not need them all. If you use Composer and would like to learn more about this feature,
    please read the [linked documentation][docs-script-composer].


## Quick Examples

### Create an Amazon S3 client

```php
<?php
// Require the Composer autoloader.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

// Instantiate an Amazon S3 client.
$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-west-2'
]);
```

### Upload a file to Amazon S3

```php
<?php
// Upload a publicly accessible file. The file size and type are determined by the SDK.
try {
    $s3->putObject([
        'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
        'Key'    => 'my-object',
        'Body'   => fopen('/path/to/file', 'r'),
        'ACL'    => 'public-read',
    ]);
} catch (Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception $e) {
    echo "There was an error uploading the file.\n";
}
```
