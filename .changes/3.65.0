That previous release changed non-required job settings to required, which prevented jobs and job templates from merging correctly. The current change removes validation of required settings from the SDK and instead centralizes the validation in the service API. For information on required settings, see the Resources chapter of the AWS Elemental MediaConvert API Reference https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/mediaconvert\/latest\/apireference\/resources.html"
