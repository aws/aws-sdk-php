These instances offer 448 logical processors, where each logical processor is a hyperthread on 224 cores. These instance deliver high networking throughput and lower latency with up to 25 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth using Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)-based Enhanced Networking. These instances are EBS-Optimized by default, and support encrypted and unencrypted EBS volumes. This instance is only available in host-tenancy. You will need an EC2 Dedicated Host for this instance type to launch an instance."
