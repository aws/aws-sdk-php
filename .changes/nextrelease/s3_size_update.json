    "description": "Updates the type of the S3 Size object to long (from integer) to properly reflect objects over PHP_INT_MAX in size. This will affect ListObjects, ListObjectsV2, ListObjectVersions, and ListParts. This bug fix may be a breaking change for customers who relied on the previously PHP_INT_MAX capped behavior or on the type of the field. You may see objects at their full size, as a string, if they are over PHP_INT_MAX in size."
