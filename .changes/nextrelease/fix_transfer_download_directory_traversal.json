    "description": "Fixed possible security issue in `Transfer`s download `transfer` operation where files could be downloaded to a directory outside the destination directory if the key contained relative paths. Ignoring files to continue with your transfer can be done through passing an iterator of files to download to `Transfer`s parameter: `$source`. These can be generated on `s3://` paths if you have registered the SDK's `StreamWrapper` via `\\Aws\\recursive_dir_iterator`."
